                <p>Hosted by the <a href="https://texas-ica.com">Indian Cultural Association</a> at The University of Texas at Austin, Jhalak is one of the only Bollywood Fusion dance competitions in America that removes production and props from the judging criteria. Every year, we invite 8 talented teams from around the nation to enjoy a memorable experience where they can cut the frills and bring the skills onstage. Our goal is to host a successful competition that allows teams to showcase the beauty of Bollywood Fusion, their talent, and their love for the art of dance. We aim to present our teams with a memorable experience and a true taste of Southern hospitality.</p>
